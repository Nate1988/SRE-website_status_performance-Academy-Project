# Contributing to website status performance Application Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the website_status_performance Application Project! We welcome contributions of all kinds — whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or suggesting ideas to make the project better.

To get started, first fork the repository from https://github.com/Nate1988/SRE-website_status_performance-Academy.git
 by clicking the “Fork” button in the top-right corner. Once forked, clone your fork locally using the command git clone https://github.com/your-username/SRE-website_status_performance-Academy.git, and navigate into the project directory.

Next, create a new branch for your changes by running git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name. This helps keep your work isolated and easier to review.

Make your changes following the project's existing code structure and conventions. Please ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and, if applicable, accompanied by relevant tests. Before committing, run the project locally and verify that all tests pass and nothing is broken.

Once you're ready, commit your changes using a clear and descriptive message, for example: git commit -m "Add health check endpoint". Push your branch to your fork with git push origin feature/your-feature-name.

After pushing, head over to your fork on GitHub and open a pull request. Describe what you’ve done, why you did it, and include any relevant context or screenshots if needed. The maintainers will review your PR, provide feedback if necessary, and help you get it merged.

If you're planning to work on a larger feature or something that significantly changes existing functionality, we recommend opening an issue first to discuss your proposal with the maintainers. This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures your effort aligns with the project’s goals.

In terms of code style, we encourage you to use clear and descriptive variable names, keep your functions small and focused, and write meaningful comments or docstrings when necessary. Readability and maintainability are more important than cleverness.

Finally, please be respectful and collaborative. We aim to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment where all contributors feel valued. Your contributions make Uptime Monitor stronger and more useful for everyone — thank you for being a part of it!

Thank you for helping improve website status performance Application Project.
